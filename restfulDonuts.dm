this is a project about donuts, they are RESTful!

this project uses nodejs/express and a JSON file to display two GET requests, one for retreving a list of donuts on the /donut url
and also another for retreving a single donut by calling it by its ID using /donut/:ID
on the index page, there are two buttons that allow you to directly redirect to the specified routes. 
There is also a table that is immediately populated with all the donut data on the index page.
